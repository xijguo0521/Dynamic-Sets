# Dynamic-Sets

**Dynamic Sets** is a programming abstraction implemented in Java that allows developers to design the interface for a single device at design time while dynamically managing and controlling multiple instances at runtime. This approach addresses the challenges posed by runtime uncertainties in ubiquitous computing environments, enabling seamless interaction with a variable number of devices.

The implementation is based on the following two publications: 
• [Dynamic Sets: A Programming Abstraction for Object Bundling](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2834965.2834973)
• [Dynamic Sets: A Programming Abstraction for Ubiquitous Computing and the Internet of Things](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3007203.3007213)
