# Dynamic-Sets

Dynamic sets is a programming abstraction implemented in Java that enables developers to program the interface of a single device at design time but to bundle and control a variable number of instances at runtime, in order to address the uncertainties about environment settings during runtime in ubiquitous computing or similar environments and make interacting with a variable number of devices easy.
